After [just short of three years](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/php-fig/kFEhviETdGM/0qXniQA4WcIJ), [PHP-FIG](http://www.php-fig.org/) has finally put an HTTP related PSR [up for vote](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/php-fig/sI91hfu-qsE/oy14FFajg6sJ).

Many thanks to everyone who has put so much work into this PSR!

Member projects, [review the proposal](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/http-message.md) (and [associated meta](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/http-message-meta.md)) and [cast your vote](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/php-fig/sI91hfu-qsE/oy14FFajg6sJ)!
