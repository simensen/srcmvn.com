Often falls into the [Not Invented Here](http://not-invented-here.com) trap.
Sometimes goes by [Kir Kryyn](http://kirkryyn.com). Founded

Are you looking for my [resume](http://beausimensen.com/resume)?


## Social Media

You can find me on Twitter as [@beausimensen](https://twitter.com/beausimensen)
and you can find me on Tent as [^simensen.tent.is](https://simensen.tent.is).
I'm on Facebook but that is mostly for friends and family. :)


## IRC

I idle in several IRC channels on **irc.freenode.net**. Look for **simensen**
in **#silex-php**, **#symfony**, **#symfony-dev**, **#composer-dev**, **#sculpin**,
or **#dflydev**.


## Notable Software Projects

 * [Sculpin](http://sculpin.io) &mdash; A PHP Static Site Generator.
 * [git-subsplit](https://github.com/dflydev/git-subsplit) &mdash; Automates and
   simplifies the process of managing one-way read-only subtree splits.


## Software

Most of my code lives under the [dflydev](https://github.com/dflydev) organization
but you can find other stuff under the [offloc](https://github.com/offloc)
organization, [sculpin](https://github.com/sculpin) organization, or mostly
forks of other projects under my personal [simensen](https://github.com/simensen)
account.
