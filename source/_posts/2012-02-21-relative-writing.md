I dig [Dave Winer](http://scripting.com/). I'm not sure at what point I
started following his blog but sometime last year I realized I was
starting to get a lot out of his feed. Reading his content has been a
huge inspiration to start producing my own. Now if only there was a way to
connect this post to his so that he'd know I had joined the conversation.
