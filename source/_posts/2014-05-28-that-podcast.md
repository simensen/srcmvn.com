Wow, we are well into 2014 and I haven't posted since last July? Ugh. Well, a lot has happened since then. *A lot*. I should get to documenting that at some point but for now I wanted to share something new!

Last week as [php[tek]](http://tek.phparch.com/) came to an end my friend [Dave Marshall](http://davedevelopment.co.uk/) and I finally launched a project we have been working on for a few months: [That Podcast](http://thatpodcast.io)

I guess it is fitting that this post follows up a few posts about Symfony Live 2013 Portland since that is where I finally had a chance to meet Dave in person. Hopefully we'll have a chance to meet in person again soon!

I'd love to get more input on our project! If you listen and want to give us feedback, make sure to either mention us on Twitter ([@thatpodcast](https://twitter.com/thatpodcast), [@beausimensen](https://twitter.com/beausimensen), or [@davedevelopment](https://twitter.com/davedevelopment)) or drop us an email at [hello@thatpodcast.io](mailto:hello@thatpodcast.io).
